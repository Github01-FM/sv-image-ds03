  In nature, android is userland framework and applications, which works on top of the linux kernel. In current
  structure, the SoC and board level difference are handled by linux bsp. This makes it possible to run the same
  android image on different SoCs and boards. Some feature level differences can be detected in runtime, such as
  the 3d, mm can be determined through the exported proc files - /proc/cpuinfo, /proc/gpuinfo.
  
  But in customer's product, it's best to use its own name.
